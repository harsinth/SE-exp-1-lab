Why Reading from a File is More Efficient:

Reading from a file is more efficient than keyboard input, especially for handling multiple sets of ingredients. Here's a brief comparison:

Keyboard Input: Efficient for one-time or small queries. It becomes slow and tedious for multiple sets.
File Input: Efficient for multiple sets of data. It processes all ingredients at once, saving time and reducing errors, especially with large datasets.
Conclusion:
For multiple sets of ingredients, reading from a file is more efficient because it allows batch processing and is scalable, while keyboard input is better suited for quick, one-time searches.
